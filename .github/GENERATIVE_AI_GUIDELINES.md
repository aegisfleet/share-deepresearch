# Generative AI Usage Guidelines

## Introduction
These guidelines provide recommendations for using generative AI tools effectively and responsibly within this project. The goal is to leverage AI to enhance productivity and code quality while mitigating potential risks.

## General Principles

### AI as a Tool
Generative AI is a powerful assistant, but developers remain the ultimate owners and are responsible for the code they commit. AI can help draft code, suggest solutions, and automate tasks, but human oversight is crucial.

### Review and Verify
All AI-generated code or suggestions must be carefully reviewed and tested before integration. Do not assume AI output is always correct, optimal, or secure.

### Security
AI-generated code can inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities. Scrutinize suggestions for common security flaws (e.g., injection vulnerabilities, improper error handling, insecure use of cryptography).

### Data Privacy
Avoid inputting sensitive, confidential, or proprietary information (e.g., API keys, personal data, unreleased code) into AI models, especially those that are cloud-based and may retain or learn from input data.

## Prompting Best Practices

### Be Clear and Specific
Write detailed and unambiguous prompts. Clearly define the desired functionality, input/output, constraints, and any specific algorithms or libraries to be used.

### Provide Context
Include relevant context in your prompts, such as existing code snippets, error messages, or descriptions of the surrounding architecture. This helps the AI generate more relevant and useful responses.

### Iterate
Don't expect perfect results from the first prompt. Experiment with different phrasings, add more context, or break down complex requests into smaller steps. Refine your prompts based on the AI's output.

## Reviewing and Using AI-Generated Code

### Understand the Code
Before integrating any AI-generated code, ensure you fully understand how it works. If you can't explain it, you shouldn't commit it.

### Test Thoroughly
Write comprehensive unit tests for AI-generated code. Perform integration testing to ensure it works correctly within the larger system.

### Check for Style and Consistency
Ensure that AI-generated code adheres to the project's coding style, conventions, and best practices. Make necessary adjustments for consistency.

### Refactor and Improve
AI-generated code is often a starting point. Refactor it for clarity, efficiency, and maintainability. Apply design patterns and best practices as you would with manually written code.

## Tool-Specific Tips
*(This section can be updated as we gain more experience with specific tools.)*

*   **GitHub Copilot:**
    *   Be mindful of its suggestions, especially in complex or unfamiliar codebases.
    *   Use it to boilerplate repetitive code sections but always review for correctness.
*   **Cursor / Other AI IDEs:**
    *   Leverage features like "edit in place" or "generate from comment" with caution. Always review the diff before accepting changes.

## Sharing and Learning
We encourage team members to:
*   Share successful prompting techniques and strategies.
*   Discuss interesting or problematic AI suggestions.
*   Collaborate on refining these guidelines as we learn more.

By following these guidelines, we can harness the benefits of generative AI while maintaining high standards for code quality, security, and collaboration.
